title: Acid based Medical Image Encryption Signal Processing

abstract:
Medical Image image encryption is very important to protect from any unauthorized user access. In this paper a two-phase secure image encryption has been proposed using the concepts of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and Ribonucleic acid (RNA). First, the plain image is encrypted based on DNA rules, DNA XOR operator, and chaotic map function in DNA phase and initial cipher image is created. Next, the cipher image is used as the input of RNA phase so that codons truth table for RNA and secret key are exploited for further image encryption. The proposed method has high resistance against common attacks in the field and achieved entropy of 7.9997. 

for run this project please follow this steps:
1: download datasets folder 
2: set 'path' variable in RNA_DNA.py file with value that indicates dataset folder. for example if you copy dataset folder in drive 'd:' you should write path='D:/datasets folder name/'
3: run program 
4: see result in datasets folder and enjoy its!

An example of the program result for '15.jpg' dataset:
